    Day 1 at Awesome Bootcamp
</h2>
<hr>

I was working as a Civil Engineer back in India. After which I moved to the US with my Husband. I am currently attending the bootcamp because I would like to make a career change into web development.

This is my first day at the bootcamp.The bootcamp is pretty hectic, where I initially learnt the basics of HTML & CSS. I have also been introduced to many CSS frameworks like Jekyll & Bootstrap. I am also learning Python as it will help me quickly progress in learning Python based frameworks like Django.
