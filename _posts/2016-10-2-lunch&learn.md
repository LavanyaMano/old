<h4>Lunch 'n' Learn</h4>

At Awesome Inc Bootcamp we do have special segment called "Lunch and Learn". As the name says we are learning new things during lunch every week. Our first lunch and learn was on day one. This session is done by guest speakers, students at bootcamps, instructors and institution members.
It is a fun way of learning new and useful things without being felt stressed over "learning". We learnt about time management,Awesome inc culture, vim, white water kayaking, drawing, playing dungenons and dragons, voice training, exercise, manufacturing,
We had fun/field trips to space tango and breakout.
