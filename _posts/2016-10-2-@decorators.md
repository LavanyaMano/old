<h2>
    Property decorators in python
</h2>
<hr>

I first came to know about property decorator when Matt used it in pizza order app. He used the @class-method to add the existing list of pizzas into the menu list of Pizza class. Then I did not have much of an idea about decorators.  Last week Friday, in morning-warmup session it was mentioned to write about concepts so far learned, which we feel difficult. The point at which we could not write would be a roadblock in understanding. 

I started wrting about @property decorator. Then I just knew, it was used once in pizza order app. I started searching on net to learn about that. I came across this article.<a href="http://www.programiz.com/python-programming/decorator">@property decorator</a>.
In that it is explained about the @decorator. In python we can able to pass a function as an argument to another function and can return a function.@ decorator is used to pass a function inside a funtion.

As list comprehension is to loops, if statements, @ decorators is to passing function inside a function, I feel that way. The decorators still have vast content in them, what I learnt is just for passing the arguments. Still a lot to learn in it. Now I am able to appreciate its use. Now when I see @login-required in django apps, I could imagine the actions it performs in the background.
