    POST method in django
</h2>
<hr>

In web, we use GET, POST, DELETE request methods.
Get method to get a data/url on request, Post is to add data, DELETE is to remove the data added.

In Django(generally in applications), we use get and GET. I understand the difference get and GET as, get is used to request data internally by the developer and GET is used to request data by the web user directly.

In Django Twitter-clone project, I used POST method at many places. POST method made use in forms I added for logins, registrations, adding, editing the datas. Also, it is used to perform actions without forms like follow/unfollow a user. I felt like I was using POST request a lot in work and I am fond of it.
